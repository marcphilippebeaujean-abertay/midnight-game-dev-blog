Happy to present the first 4-person interview for the podcast! Matt and JeeDee, founders of Loopowl, as well as Moises from Mainleaf join me to share how the two companies started collaborating on making games.
  
Of course we focused on chatting about the development of both of their upcoming games, Fury and Rogue Masters. Both companies have a lot of very experienced folks working for them, so it was interesting to hear about the different insights that they had to share.

This discussion was very interesting, because the Loopowl founders are also involved in the publishing side of game development. Very interesting to hear what they look for in a game, so perhaps you might learn some lessons on how you can improve your game's pitch!
