Gang Beasts is a highly successful indie game, grossing millions in revenue and was also nominated for the British Academcy Games Awards for best multiplayer game.

I had a chat with Michael Brown, who is one of the three brothers that co-founded their games studio **Boneloaf**, to get some "behind the scenes" insights into the development of their game. 
We had a chat about their non-traditional background and how they got started making games.

We also talked about their iteration and learning process that helped them get the game to where it is today, with several rewrites of the entire code base. I hope you 
guys enjoy the episode!
