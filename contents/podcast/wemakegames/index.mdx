Chira Chopra is the creator of [wemake.games](https://wemake.games) and a co-founder of Lucid Labs, an alternative mobile game indie studio.

We had a chat about staying motivated as an indie developer and how to succeed in the mobile game space as an indie studio without making Free To Play style games.
