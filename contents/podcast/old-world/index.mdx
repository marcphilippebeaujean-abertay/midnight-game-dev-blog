Leyla Johnson is the CEO of Mohawk Games, a company founded by her husband Sorin. The title that they are currently working on is called **Old World**, available [on early access](https://www.epicgames.com/store/de/product/old-world/home), and is reminiscent of games such as Sid Meier's Civilizations IV, for which her husband was the lead designer.

She shared how she transitioned into the games industry by helping her husband design and improve the company's first game, Offworld Trading Company. From there, we discuss the steps it took for them to eventually release Old World, the complications that came up in that time and more.

Finally, we chat about games company building and the culture in the industry. Leyla shares how she is actively hoping to create the inclusive climate and culture in her own company, that she would like to see everyone in the industry adopt.

We mention a podcast episode about Olga of Kiev in our conversation, you can listen to it [here](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vcmlkaWN1bG91c2hpc3Rvcnk/episode/YmQ2Njk0YzYtNDcwOS0xMWU4LTk5ODMtZWJjYWFmYzA5Nzdl?hl=de&ved=2ahUKEwi_h8DmldHqAhXOzqQKHU8EClQQjrkEegQICxAE&ep=6).
