 We continue our previous chat on VR and his latest game Jet Island, covering many interesting topics along the way. One of these was the multiplayer in Jet Island and how he implemented it.

 Another conversation point was marketing a VR game and how he built his first game, Sword Master VR, to be content creator friendly by adding in show features. Finally, he reflects and gives us some tips on how he would advise someone who is looking to make a living by creating games.
