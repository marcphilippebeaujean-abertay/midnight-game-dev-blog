Matt Larrabee is the solo developer behind Greylock Studios and the upcoming bullettime FPS IMPACT.

<PrimalLight />

In this interview discussion, he shared how the resource constraints of being a solo developer lead to the interesting decision of creating a protagonist for his game that only has one arm.  
  
Matt uses Unreal Engine to develop his game and we went into technical details as to how he created some of features in his game, for example the [Voxel Plugin](https://voxelplugin.com/) that he used to create the destructible environments.  
  
We also had a chat about investment offers that he has gotten from VC and game publishing firms. It was a very informative episode and really highlighted the power of Unreal Engine - I hope you enjoy it!
