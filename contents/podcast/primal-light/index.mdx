Primal Light is a linear action platformer designed by a two-man team, Fat Gem Games. One of the developers joined me to share the story behind their game.

As a result of learning Python for machine learning, Shane (lead programmer on the team) decided to start working on Primal Light in Pygame. He soon ran into engine limitations and switched over to Godot, which is what the engine is now built in.

They also revealed how over the course of developing their game, they made drastic changes over time. One of these was the pivot from creating a metroidvania, a genre known to be particularly complex to develop, to a more linear style of game. It was a very insightful interview that anyone working on their game part-time is going to learn a lot from!
