Mana Break Studios is a Hyper Casual Studio founded by 2 friends that met at University. Now, they landed their first deal with a hyper casual game publisher.  

The two developers share their experience of getting into Hyper Casual and the lessons that they learned. Hope you enjoy and learn from what they had to share!
