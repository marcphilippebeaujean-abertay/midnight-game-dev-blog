Since its his first time developing such an ambitious title, Bogdan shared the lessons learned and the challenges he faced, including how he overcame the all to well known challenge of needing to create a lot of content for an RPG to keep it engaging. He also talked remote work and how his team divides their workloads. It was a very interesting chat and I hope you guys enjoy!
