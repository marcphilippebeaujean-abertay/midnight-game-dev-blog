Bryn Welch is the lead designer on Dungeon Top by One Up Plus Entertainment, a 3 person indie games studio. They share the story of their latest game, Dungeon Top.

Among many other things, he shared his interesting backstory of getting the job by criticising the CEO's game prototype extensively and his approach of 
motivating the player by "making them feel smart". We also discussed the dynamic between him and his CEO, who is also doing the programming, which revolves around rapidly 
iterating and improving the game.

It was a really fun and insightful chat, hope it helps folks out there improve their games!
