Hyper Casual has been a growing phenomenon in the mobile gaming space for the last 5 years - games that make a vast majority of their revenue through advertising. Matte Studios have 
recently release their hit game Crowd Masters 3D with Voodoo, the biggest publisher in the Hyper Casual space.

Erdem and Gocke of Matte Studios were nice enough to share the background of the company, as well as how they go into making mobile games. This eventually lead to them diving into 
Hyper Casual after discovering Voodoo and learning how to leverage their data-driven approach to improve their games. It was really educational, hope you guys enjoy it too!
