Nathaniel Ayer moved to Egypt with his Family to build Himeko Sutori, to reduce his cost of living to the point where he can work fulltime on the JRPG tactics game he had been developing.

He shared what lead him to making this drastic decision and whether he would recommend the same to others. We also discussed his current approach to developing and marketing the game. It was a super interesting chat!
