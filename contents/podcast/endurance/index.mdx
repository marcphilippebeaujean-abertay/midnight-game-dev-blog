Ivan Panasenko is the creator of [Ailment](http://www.ivanpanasenko.com/ailment/) and [Endurance](http://www.ivanpanasenko.com/endurance/), two mobile games with thousands of downloads on the Apple and Google App stores. 
He is also known for creating some popular YouTube videos on his channel, where he depicts his earnings in more detail - I really recommend checking it out!

In this episode he shares his thought process behind creating his titles, getting monetization advice from a huge chinese mobile games company and much more - it really was a fascinating 
story! I hope you guys enjoy it.
