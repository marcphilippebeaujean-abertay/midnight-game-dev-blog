Tom Goodchild has spent all of his career working at games companies of various sizes. He shares some of the things that he had done at these companies as an employee and what it actually means to be a professional game designer.  
  
After working in the industry for many years, Tom decided he wanted to build his own game and quit his job! That game ended up being Socketeer, a top-down 2D roguelite.   
  
<Socketeer />

During the discussion, he admitted to making mistakes with his first indie project that he is hoping to avoid for the development of his next game. 
We also talked about the challenges that occured and how to prepare for doing your own thing as an employee, before diving in head first as your own boss.
