Today, I had a chat with Matt Trobbiani on his hit game [Hacknet](https://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/Hacknet/?snr=1_1056_4_creator_1059&curator_clanid=38042151), a hacking simulator, and his upcoming sports title [Wrestledunk Sports](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1301520/Wrestledunk_Sports/?snr=1_1056_4_creator_1059&curator_clanid=38042151).

His first game, a result of a game jam that Matt held with his friends and he later iterated upon, became a massive success. We take a behind the scenes look on how it was developed and how he made realistic hacking simulator more accessible to non-technical folks.  
  
Of course we also chat about his upcoming title, Wrestledunk Sports, and the super technical netcode which he built from scratch. Very interesting chat on how competitive games fix problems with latency in games.
