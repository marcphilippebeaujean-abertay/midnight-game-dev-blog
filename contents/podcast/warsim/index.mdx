Huw Millward's journey into game development began with him wanting to teach himself how to code in C++ by making simple console text prompt games. After receiving positive feedback upon releasing one of these games, he started turning it into what is now known as Warsim: The Realm of Aslona.

In the interview, he shared his approach to engaging and growing the community around the game, by actively listening to their feedback and improving the game. He also mentioned strategies on how he encouraged players to make suggestions and report bugs! It was a very interesting chat that was very eye opening and shows the power of hitting the right niche with your game.
