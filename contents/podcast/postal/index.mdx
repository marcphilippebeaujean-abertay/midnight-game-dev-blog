The Postal series made its mark in the gaming space as the first game to allow players to attack and urinate on innocent bystanders. Now, Postal 4 is about to release and I had a chat with Mike Jaret (co-owner of the company) on how they went about developing it!

Not only did we discuss the development of Postal 4, but also the interesting backstory of the Postal series, including their "indexing" in Germany due to the amount of violence in the game. Mike shared the company's approach to hiring and building a company culture around the postal brand, to ensure candidates are a good fit.

It was a very fun and informative chat, Mike is a hilarious guy with lots of great information to share. Hope you enjoy the episode!
