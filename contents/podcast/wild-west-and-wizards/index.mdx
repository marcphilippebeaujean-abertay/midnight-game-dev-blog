Lavaboots Studios are the two-man team behind the open world games "Salt" and their latest game: "Wild West and Wizards".

In this interview discussion, they shared the founding story behind their studio and how both of them got each other into game development, after knowning each other from a very young age.  
  
Another topic was the game development process and approach to creating these massive game worlds. This included everything from the world design, to optimising 
the performance of the game in their engine of choice, Unity3D.
