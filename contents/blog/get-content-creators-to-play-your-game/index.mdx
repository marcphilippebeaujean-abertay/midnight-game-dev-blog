## Create a list of Creators that fit your Game

There are many content creators out there and reaching out to every single one is probably not the best use of your time. Instead, you are going to want to reach out to content creators that are known for covering the same type of game that you are about to publish. Fortunately, there are all kinds of niches when it comes to games content creators – think of PewDiePie for example, he started experiencing massive growth on his channel by focusing on just creating content for a single game (Amnesia, the Dark Descent)! The more well aligned your game is with the niche of that content creator, the higher the chances of them picking it up.  

That said, you don’t necessarily need to find a super niche YouTuber. Another important aspect is the hardware. If you are making a VR or mobile game, you have to make sure that the given content creator has the right hardware to record content for your game (if they haven’t done so in the past, you are probably wasting your time).  

Find some games that are similar to yours and search for “Let’s Plays” of that game. What YouTubers come up? Now, do the same for streamers. One reason I would start with YouTube is because its easier to browse and with both platforms, you are likely to target the other by default (streamers often have YouTube channels and vice versa). Create an Excel spreadsheet with some of the contact information that you can find and communities that they are active in.  

## Create a Content Creator friendly Game

You can make an active attempt at increasing the attractiveness of a game for content creators.   

### Make sure it is fun to watch, not just play 
Text based games can be great fun! But to watch? Not so much. A games “watchability” has a lot to do with how well what the player is doing is reflected by the visuals and/or gameplay experience. One thing that makes gameplay fun to watch is decisions – wondering what the content creator is going to do next, while thinking about what you would have done yourself. That’s why successful games don’t necessarily have to be action games, narrative games with lots of decisions that impact the story are great content for YouTubers and Streamers. Games that are difficult and or vary greatly depending on the skill of the player can also make for great material, because it’s awesome to watch someone play a challenging game who is very good at it (a popular phenomenon to support this: esports!).  

### Ensure it has intriguing visuals 
Visuals are very important in grasping the attention of any consumer, content creators are no exception. In this case, they are going to be extra careful, because if the game does not look interesting they also have a smaller chance of growing their audience. Make sure your game’s graphics and marketing material (trailers, store front, screenshots, etc.) stand out when they take a look at the store page or demo link you sent, otherwise they are probably not going to bother covering it.  

### The game should invoke emotions 
Games that lead to extreme emotions are going to make for interesting (and at least more genuine) content, hence why horror games were very popular in the YouTube scene as they invoke the emotion of fear. Another popular type of game among content creators were “rage games”, titles that were designed to be unfair and have an absurd level of difficulty, thus invoking the emotion of anger. There are many ways to make your game more emotional, considering how you want the player to feel is always important.  

### Include built-in Streaming Features
Most streaming platforms offer have interfaces that let you create features in your game that allow the streamer or viewers to interact with the gameplay. This can be a deciding factor for a streamer deciding what to play next, as they will probably tend to choose the game with streaming features over one without.  

## Sending out a cold Email/DM

Of course the best way to reach someone directly with a business request is by sending them a message. At this point, you want to review the spreadsheet you compiled earlier with all the contact information of  potential content creators that could cover your game. Take a look at the different ways you can contact them and try to determine what the best avenue is. Email? Discord? Twitter? Make sure its the most personal and maybe try to determine where they are most active. Don’t try to spam them on every possible platform at once, since this gives off a bad vibe. Make sure you are not trying to desperately send out emails to everyone at once.  

Start sharing news with your contacts list as soon as you have something to show, make them aware of this game! They are probably not going to cover the fact that you got your announcement trailer out, but seeing the name of your game show up in the inbox makes them aware of its existence and ensures that it rings a bell when it is mentioned elsewhere.  

### How to write a good Email to Content Creators

When send out emails to YouTubers/Streamers/etc., make sure to keep the message concise and not too formal. Make sure you are not pampering the content creator and treating it like a formal business email – these guys are just normal people who like playing games and are in the fortunate situation of making money from it.  

Before you send your message, make sure it has a good structure. YouTuber TotalBuiscuit made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pRDRCorx14) about this and mentioned that he appreciated when he was sent the Steam key as the first thing in the message, so he can check out the game right away. Another good tip if you are sending an email is to add images or other interesting things to make it stand out. Make sure you are not overdoing it and thus distracting or annoying the reader Here is an example TotalBuiscuit outlined as a good cold outreach email, notice the interesting game art and steam key right at the top of the email, as well as the subject mentioning that the game key is included:

If you are cold emailing/messaging, be prepared to face a lot of rejection! That said, do not fear following up on your emails despite not getting a response. It is not too unlikely that the content creator did not see your message (they probably get very many) or simply did not deem it that interesting at the time. Remember: you want to be sharing news of your game early.  

## Become a Member of their Community (or advertise to them)
Most content creators, just like games companies, try to build a list of followers and a community around them. If you are part of or make a name for yourself in that community, you are more likely to get the attention of that content creator. If not, then perhaps their fans are more likely to request coverage of your game!  
## Pay Creators Money
The simplest way to get a content creator to play their game? Pay them! If you have a high marketing budget, than this is certainly viable, since having content creators promote your game is one of the best ways to gain exposure for it. That said, getting a content creator to play your game organically is not only a good way to validate your game, but also more likely to turn into viewers into customers. Remember: in many countries, content creators are legally obliged to mention that they are paid to display certain content, so that will automatically count against your game as the audience knows they didn’t voluntarily choose to feature it.  
## Include the Content Creator in your Game
This is another radical tactic – many game developers have added content around a big streamer or YouTuber, in order for them to play it. While I think this is viable, it can mean that you are potentially investing a lot of time creating that additional content and also making sure the content creator actually sees it (the latter probably being the bigger problem, depending on the creator’s popularity).

Be aware that this is something that can seem like an obvious PR stunt to your players and leave a bad aftertaste. In addition, it looks pretty silly if the content creator does NOT end up playing the game, which is quite likely if they are a very popular persona that has many sutdios fighting for their attention. So overall, I don’t advise this strategy unless you are sure that the content creator will see that you added that content to their game, perhaps because you already talked to them beforehand and agreed to collaborate in this manner.  
  
On the flipside, it can be a great idea to actively collaborate with a content creator if they are down. For example, you can offer them to do voice acting for your game, which is a sure way to get their fans excited and increase the chances of them becoming customers.
