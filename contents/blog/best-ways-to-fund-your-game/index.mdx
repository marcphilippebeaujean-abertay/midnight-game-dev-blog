You got a great and ambitious idea for your next big game? Great! What you are going to need next
is programmers, artists, marketers – in other words, a lot of money. In the following guide, I’ll be
giving you an overview of the different paths you can take and consider when trying to raise capital
to fund your next project.

## Crowdfunding

### What it is

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter allow you to pitch your product directly to the consumers,
which then offer some amount of money to help you develop it. You have to define the amount
needed to develop the product beforehand, but only if the amount raised exceeds your goal do you
actually get ANY money (to protect backers from financing a project that does not have a chance of
succeeding). As a reward for supporting the project, these individuals get backer pledges in return
based on the amount they funded (that you as the host define), such as early access to the product or
exclusive merchandise.

### Why it might be interesting for you

Crowdfunding is first on this list because in theory it is ideal for B2C consumer products like
games, since not only do you get to sell to your target audience before creating the product, but you
also get valuable feedback and market research even if you fail to raise money. In addition, you
have access to a pool of excited alpha or beta testers for your game, that will help polish it before
release.

### What you should be aware of

Raising money through crowdfunding is not a piece of cake – people have gotten burned hard in the
past from scammers who raised money and then vanished, never releasing a product. This means
that you need to convey that you are legit (branding is very important) and have the expertise to
create the product. The best way to do this is to have a solid prototype to show when releasing your
campaign. Your pledges and rewards also need to be appealing, but beware: if you do not take the
costs of fulfilling these pledges into account (for example material and shipping costs for physical
goods that you want to send out to backers) then you can end up with less money remaining than
you expected! This makes crowdfunding a difficult balancing act to pull off.

### The most common Crowdfunding Platforms for Games

#### Kickstarter
Biggest crowdfunding platform, there are all kinds of products on here, including thousands of
games. This is going to be where you can reach the biggest audience, but also face the most
competition.

#### IndieGogo
Smaller than Kickstarter, but more or less the same idea.


#### Fig
New kid on the block, focused specifically on gaming. This might be a great choice to promote a
game without a large following, as you have the lowest competition here.

## Publisher

### What it is

Game publishers have been the traditional way of raising money for a game. The publisher, besides
providing you with funding for your game, usually also takes care of some of the marketing for
your game through the companies PR connections or by producing trailers and other promotional
material. A publisher will take some percentage of the game’s revenue share for their work, which is
how the company sustains itself – if the game is a failure for your company, then its also going to be
one for the publisher. Some companies get bought up by publishers if they are successful, but it is
quite unlikely that this is going to be the case when you are just pitching your first game idea.

### Why it might be interesting for you

Game publishers are great if you plan to release a game that is designed to be a one-time purchase
(most Steam or console games). This is because it makes the revenue model quite simple. Most
publishers are also more comfortable with this pricing model, because if they offer you additional
services like marketing, PR or promotional content creation, then they will have a good idea of the
time frame that they need to provide those services for (unlike a free to play game for example,
which requires continuos marketing efforts).

### What you should be aware of

To get funded by a publisher, you need to make them aware that you exist and have a great game
that is worth funding. Anyone can start a fundraiser on a crowdfunding page (baring a few basic
quality checks from the platform), but getting noticed by a publisher is a challenge of itself. The
most popular get swamped with applications, while the less popular or newer publishers are less
likeyl to be able to offer you the same level of support. The best way you can get the attention of a
publisher is by doing your research on them – find out if they have published games similar to the
one you are hoping release, otherwise the chances of you getting funded by them is VERY low.
Once you identified a list of potential publishers, the best way to reach them is by having
connections connect you with the team or writing a cold email that is personalised and gives a brief
overview of your game idea. Make sure to list anything that will increase your chances, like fancy
media or credentials of people in the team. Don’t send them a file with a prototype and expect them
to play it – they won’t have time!

Next, if you are able to stand out enough and the publisher is interested in learning more about your
game, you will get invited to pitch it. For this, you will need to provide what is called a “pitch deck”
for your game! A pitch deck is short presentation that you can show the publisher, to help convey
your vision and get them excited about it. We are going to go into more detail about what makes a
great games pitch in an upcoming section, but know for now that this is your best shot at scoring a
publishing deal and thus its really important that you create an awesome presentation.

### Some of the biggest Indie Game Publishers

#### Devolver Digital

Founded 2009, they are well established as one of the biggest indie games publishers and well
known for their E3 shows, where things often escalate quite quickly. These guys know how to
market games using witty humour and have some very impressive titles in their portfolio (Enter the
Gungeon, Hotline Miami).

## Venture Capital

### What it is

This option is deceptively similar to going with a publisher and thus a lot of the advice from the
previous section still applies here, but there are some key differences that can alter the course of
your game development process considerably. Just like a publisher, a venture capitalist (VC) or VC
firm is going to supply you with money up front to build your game and you will need to convince
the VC to provide you the funding with a pitch, just like you would for a publisher. Here is where
the first difference kicks in: the VC will not want to have a percentage share of your current game’s
revenue, he will want a share of your entire company. It’s important to understand the VC’s
objective: to buy stocks of the company in the early stages for (comparatively) little money and then
sell it at a very high price, when its profitable or has a lot of buzz around it. This is why it is
important that you focus on pitching the company and its vision, not just a single game.

### Why it might be interesting for you

The VC will want to see that your business plan favours to grow the company for the long term, as
this will raise the company value. This also means that VC is much more suited for certain types of
games than others. For example, “Free to Play” or “Games as a Service” titles have a much higher
chance of reaching a sustainable, predictable and scalable income (what the VC will be looking for)
than a company that is just trying to create one-of PC and console games. Experimental or novel


ideas that leverage upcoming technologies (like Crypto, Metaverse or AI) are often something that
excites VC, since these offer untapped potential that could lead to high profitability.

Because the VC does not rely on the success of a single game that you make, but rather the “end
result” i.e. your company being successful or going bankrupt, its encouraged for VC backed games
founders to experiment and release as many games as they can before the money runs out or one of
their games finds market fit. This can be very valuable for first-time games founders with a less
experienced team.

### What you should be aware of

Its important to understand the ramifications of the VC model and selling part of your company for
funding. If you give away too much of your company, then the VC holds a lot of power, potentially
enabling them to make drastic decisions if they disagree with the way that you run the company.
This is why its important to choose very wisely from what VC you want to invest in – your vision
and that of the VC need to be well aligned. Make sure they know a lot about the games industry,
which will make it easier for you to negotiate with them and means that they can advise you when
necessary – remember, however, that VC prefer to be fairly hands off, as they invest in a lot of
companies and only expect a few to succeed. VC also generally do not provide you with additional
services like marketing (which a publisher would), so you have to make sure you are allocating
funds to take care of it yourself, either by hiring full-time employees or outsourcing it to another
company.

### Some of the biggest VC Funds that invest in Games Companies

#### Galaxy Interactive
Venture fund interested in exploring the ramifications of integrating technologies like Crypto to
provide real ownership of digital goods in games or build large scale metaverses. Very interesting
podcast episode with the founders on the Elite Game Developers podcast.

#### Play Ventures
One of the biggest games-focused venture funds, focused on games with scalable business models
(Free to Play, Games as a Service, etc.) or software solutions for the games industry.

#### Bitkraft

One of Bitkraft’s biggest focuses lies in “synthetic realities”, to blur the lines between digital and
physical realms. They invest into providing ownership (implying crypto) for digital goods, but are
also interested in the opportunities revolving around XR experiences (developing technology for
devices or the software/games themselves).

#### Game Seer

Game Seer is one of the few funds that focuses on premium Steam and console games. This makes
them closer to a traditional games publishing company!

## Publishing via an Early Access Program

### What it is

The concept of “early access” is that the player can purchase a game that is still in development,
funding the developers so they can release and improve it. The incentive for the player is that they
get to play the game early and provide feedback. Early access programs have been evolving over
the last decade, but are now available on all major phone and PC game stores.

### Why it might be interesting for you

If you already have a game built to the point where it is a fun, playable prototype that you feel
already has the potential to sell, then it might be a good idea to go for an early access program.

### What you should be aware of

Just like crowdfunding, bad actors have given this funding method a bad name. Some early access
games are sold and then never fully released, ending up in “early access hell”. That said, the reasons
for this are usually not because the developers had ill intentions. One of the most common is that
the game simply does not get enough traction and thus development cannot be continued because
there is not enough money left.

Because of all the unfinished or poor quality games coming out of early access, players are less
forgiving these days and don’t hesitate to give bad reviews, even if the game is still in development.
That in turn can lead to less sales and demotivation amongst members of the team. Make sure that
when you release on early access, you focus on polish over content. A polished game that lacks
content is going to be enjoyable for the short time that it is played, but not vice versa. In addition,
early access players are going to be more excited about the release of new content, rather than a list
of bug fixes and minor improvements made to get it to release quality.

## Bootstrapping

### What it is

Game developers or companies that build their games without getting external funding are said to
be “bootstrapping”, with means “to build something using one’s own resources and experience”.
Quite a few games companies start out this way for their initial prototypes, but later look towards
external investment to be able to finish the game with the desired level of polish. Because
bootstrapping is so popular in the initial stages of a games development, crowdfunding is so popular
for games – many developers use the platform to get the funding necessary to go fulltime for the
final months, after developing a solid prototype using their own time and money.

### Why it might be interesting for you

Bootstrapping is primarily for people who cannot find funding through other means, but strongly
believe in the vision of their game. Rather than giving up on the idea, they decide to start building
the game by financing it themselves, usually by doing consulting work for other companies or by


building it part-time next to their job as an employee. Another reason might be because they don’t
like to give up creative freedom or power to a third party like a publisher or investor.

### What you should be aware of

In many ways, bootstrapping is when you want to go true “indie”, but usually there is a point where
getting at least some funding is the rational choice. For example, when you have already
bootstrapped the game to a point where its presentable but benefit from some additional funding to
really polish it, there are little arguments that speak against starting a crowdfunding campaign or
going on an early access program to get player feedback and income that will help you make drastic
improvements before launch.

Finally, bootstrapping requires very strong will power. Maintaining another source of income while
working on your game is very difficult and means you need to be very good at time management,
otherwise you will not be able to work productively. Allocate time to both your game and potential
main source of income that you use to pay your expenses (consulting, a job, etc.).
