"Making a game is hard. Creating an amazing product requires excellence in multiple disciplines, ranging from art to software engineering. But that alone is not enough - you need to market your game so that people hear about and play it. All of this is incredibly time and skill intensive, as anyone who undertook developing their own game will tell you.

Despite all of this, there are thousands of game developers worldwide, working day and night to realise their projects. This is because the industry is driven by passion and creative spirit. Some of these developers - the independents or "indies" - are working in small teams or alone, without a publisher or investors. They do so to ensure the quality and integrity of their game, while having total freedom and control.

Starting a games company, especially when it's self funded, is a very risky move. Hence, many indie game developers prefer to work on their games during their free time, while balancing the development with a fulltime job (also known as "moonlighting"). Others prefer to jump head first into fulltime, using their savings to fund the development. This project is dedicated to those that make games, to help them succeed and share their stories. I hope you join me for the ride!"
