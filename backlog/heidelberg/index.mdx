Sebastian Anrade is a game designer from Heidelberg, which ended up inspiring his latest game now on Steam.

<Heidelberg />

He talks about how he teamed up with an illustrator that he met and how the two ended up becoming business partners. Their game
has strong inspirations from history and philosophy, ultimately leading to a design challenge that they had to fix around the main
mechanic. It was an interesting chat, hope you guys learn from and enjoy it!
