Justin Scott is a fulltime software engineer, who works on his VR games at night. I checked in with him to find out more about the development of his latest game, Stacksquatch!

<Stacksquatch />

We had an interesting chat about VR, the capabilities of the technology and his background making novel plugins for different devices. We then transitioned into talking about how he got started with the game 
and the different challenges he had to face. One of the main focuses was making the VR game more accessible and less frustrating to play, as it can be quite challenging to the UX right.

Really fun chat, Justin is a great guy and I hope you have as much fun listening to his story as I had!
