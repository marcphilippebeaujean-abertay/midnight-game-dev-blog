Networking is the act of creating or improving professional connections with other people, usually
from the same line of work. Many people who are new to the games industry ask the question: how
can you network with others as a game developer? This is because networking 
has many benefits, here to only list a few:

- landing a job is much easier if you have a referral from someone you already know within
    the company
- when looking to hire talent for a specific purpose, you have a much bigger pool of people to
    choose from of which you already know the skills and strengths
- finding a potential co-founder for a games startup becomes much easier
- learn valuable insights from others in areas where you might not be as knowledgeable
- increasing your own credibility and influence within your given industry (gaming, for this
    purpose)
- you can help each other promote your games  

  
Putting yourself out there and actively engaging in conversations with others is the first and most
important step to networking. When you have no network, its very unlikely that someone will tell
you to attend an event or join a community of like-minded individuals.

In the following guide, I’ll be giving you some tips on how to make connections and find other
developers to network with. These will include a structured list of the best communities to join and
other activities that will help you create lasting professional relationships for your career.

## Connect through LinkedIn

One of the most obvious places for professional networking is LinkedIn, a social media for
professionals. If you don’t have an account you should make one and ensure it looks as appealing as
possible to anyone visiting it. This will not only be beneficial when applying to jobs, but also when
messaging others that have matching profiles that you want to connect with.

Another great feature of LinkedIn are the groups, which make it much easier to meet new game
developers online, with the intention of connecting on a professional level. There are many game
development groups on LinkedIn, here is a list of the groups that I found to be the biggest:

## Get active in a Discord channel

Though Discord announced it will be pivoting away from being a platform for gaming, it is still
deeply routed in gaming culture. As a result, many games companies host Discord channels for their
communities and of course, there are also many Discord channels for game developers to chat. The
benefit of Discord is that the chat rooms are usually labeled by particular topics, making it easy to
find out what users are knowledgeable in what areas. Some even require users to assign themselves
a job label as they enter, making it even easier to distinguish.

Here is a list of the game development channels that I find to be the most active and interesting:


## Attend/Sett up a booth at large gaming events

Games conventions and expositions are a great place to meet new game developers, because
particularly at the indie booths, the people behind the games will be right there for you to talk to
them. Of course you should set yourself some limits, as most developers wont be there just to chit-
chat. That said, your chances of connecting with a notorious game developer are much higher here,
since you don’t run into the problem of them simply ignoring your DM or emails.

If you happen to be someone with a booth at such an event, you will attract the attention of other
developers. If you are looking for new connections, you should make sure to bring some business
cards that you can hand out. That way you are not wasting time exchanging details after the
conversation is over, which you could be spending by talking to potential customers.

There are also game development events, some of them very large. These are obviously ideal for
face-to-face networking, as its basically expected at a game development conference, for example.
That said, these events are usually also more exclusive and to be able to enter you are usually
required to have at least a somewhat bigger reputation than you might when you are just getting
started. Here is a list of some of the biggest game development events:

## Attend, and ideally present at, Meetups

Game development meetups can be thought of as a smaller, localized version of a gaming event.
However, this makes it ideal for networking, as you are more likely to get into private conversation
with other attendees. The game development meetups that I have been to often allow developers to
present some of their work, which I definitely recommend doing if you have something to show.
This usually leads to great conversation with others after you are done presenting and opens
opportunities to meet new people.

My favorite way to find meetups in my area is still Meetup (despite the pricing controversy after the
companies acquisition), but if you guys have any other alternatives feel free to share them in the
comments.

## Connect through Twitter

Twitter is a surprisingly handy way of networking with complete strangers, either by being
discovered yourself or actively searching for individuals. Due to the hashtag system on tweets, you
can be easily found by others through consistent content postings. Make sure you are checking what
hashtags are most popular, some like “indiedev” are going to be quite competitive but also reach
more people, while others like “connectingwithaudioengineers” are not going to find that many
individuals. The exact same applies when you are using these hashtags to search for interesting
developers that you want to connect with!

If you want to reach out to someone or get their attention, you can use the fact that Twitter is a very
open social media to your advantage. Comment or retweet their content and send them a DM once
you noticed them liking or interacting with some of your own content. Twitter is great for building
connections, because you can start with small gestures and build up the relationship slowly, without
even having to know the person.


## Host/attend events at Universities

Universities are generally filled with talented young people and many students looking into fields
like visual art or computer science are probably going to be interested in a career in the games
industry. If you are looking to hire or find co-founders for a new games venture, universities can be
a great place to connect with others, since young people are generally more likely to take on the
stress and risk that is associated with this. You can attend or host social/professional events for
students. Some universities even have student run game development societies, look out for these
since they often host events that are ideal for networking with like-minded individuals! Someone I
know actually attended lectures as a guest, only so that he could find a co founder for his startup
(and it worked!).

## Join Facebook groups

While I didn’t initially think that Facebook would be a good place to network, there are still a
decent amount of groups for game developers. That said, this isn’t the ideal place as Facebook is a
platform where getting direct messages from strangers is generally frowned upon and connecting in
other manners can be pretty hard. Either way, I thought it would be worth sharing a list of my
favorite game development Facebook groups:

## Use professional networking Subreddits

I really think that Reddit is not that great for networking because its a pretty impersonal platform,
but there are some sub reddits designed specifically for this purpose. Here are a few that you can
