Erik Rempen is creating the unique village building game Kainga, inspired by one of his favourite childhood games. We had a discussion about his game, including how
he went from having no game development experience and teaching himself everything from art to blueprint programming. He is also working a full time job and dedicating most of his free time to the game! Kainga is set to release on Steam Early Access only a couple years later.

In our chat, he details how he approached his Kickstarter, his story of going from 0 to where he is now and more. Hope you enjoy!
